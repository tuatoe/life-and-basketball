After escaping the Liberian civil war, he found himself in the United States of America. And having no knowledge of the game of basketball, he instantly fell in love with the game while watching Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks make a free throw, while awaiting his flight to Minnesota, his new home, from the JFK International Airport.</p>
               
               <p>Upon arrival to Minnesota, his passion for the game grew, it enables him to quickly assimilate into the American culture, but mostly importantly, it kept him in school and out of trouble. Moses surrounded himself with great coaches and mentors like Brian Sandifer, Jim Speidel, and others, who helped elevated his game. While playing under the mentorship and coaching of Sandifer, Moses quickly earn respect and recognition among his peers, and was able to enjoy all basketball had to offer at that time. </p>
               
               <p>He later played for Northview Junior High School, now Northview Middle School, where with the help of his fellow teammate, Carrington, he took the Knights to their first ever Semi final appearance (in a long time), losing to Brooklyn Junior High School. He concluded Northview Jr High School and went on to Saint Bernard's High School (in St Paul), where he had the opportunity to play both Junior Varsity and Varsity under one of the finest coaches in the State, Ed Cassidy. </p>
               
               <p>Moses also had the opportunity to play with powerhouse players like Deonate Roberts, Chad Jones, Jeremy Sutherland, and Trevor Mbakwe. He was part of the St Bernard’s 2006-2007 undefeated team (33-0 record) that took second place in the in the 2007 Minnesota State Tournament. The team only loss came at the State Tournament against Wisconsin’s Ellsworth High School.  At the start of his senior year, Moses transferred to Lourdes High School in Rochester, Minnesota where he only played half of the season due to what he believe to be an act of favoritism. </p>
               
               <p>Moses quit the team to focus on school. After graduation, he went on to St. Mary’s University of Minnesota where he earned a BA in Political Science/Pre-law. While at St Mary, he for go being a player and focused on earning his degree. Although he was not actively playing, he was still around the game. His first coaching experience was when he coached 7th grade Boys basketball at Wabasha Kellogg public school in Wabasha, MN while attending St Mary. </p>
               
               <p>It wasn't until 2012 that Moses gives birth to the vision of using basket as platform to positively impact the world. This idea he calls Life &amp; Basketball. He had travelled to Liberia and Ghana hosting basketball camps and plans to reach more countries starting in 2018. Upon graduating from St Mary, he decided to go into the health field because he believes sport and health together can be a power thing. </p>
               
               <p>He is currently pursuing a degree in the health field. Upon graduating in 2018, he plans to push the vision behind Life &amp; Basketball until he falls down and die.</p>
