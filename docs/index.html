                        <p>Basketball is about teamwork. Even a star player can’t do it all. The five teammates on the court must work together to create plays.

                        <p>Whether you’re playing competitively in a league or just for recreation at the park, basketball benefits your social life. You may form friendships that drift off at the close of the season or last for years. Even if you don’t become buddy-buddy with many members of your team, the skills you learn dealing with the different personality types can help you in situations off the court. You may learn to better relate to difficult personalities at work, for example. Basketball can give you more confidence in your daily life, and it can help you to accept those times you don’t win or get what you want</p>
